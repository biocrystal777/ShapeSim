# ShapeSim
ShapeSim is a new evaluation method for a new approach to determine
the explicit axis lengths of anisotropic nanoparticles based on the 
combination of data from different hydrodynamic analysis methods.
The code will be published here when the corresponding publication 
has been accepted.
ShapeSim is written in C++ and features a rudimentary generator of
gnuplot for its own created data set.
